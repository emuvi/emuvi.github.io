              solutions as their main business intelligence and operation software. To develop
              the Pointel stack was a big challenge to me. It defy my self professional
              perspectives and skills. In order to succeed I had to evolve the very core of my

              of excellence. The professional I meet and worked with it were of the higher kind.
              We develop solutions on the administrative and education environments. Working on
              the education department in many occasions I was asked upon to perform and deliver
              tasks typical of a data scientist. So, I've created innumerous algorithms and data
              structures to extract, transform and load information. Mostly in Python, but in
              Ruby also. Developing these solutions helped the institution, at least I like to
              believe, to maintain on the pace with it's high level of excellence.</div>

              main areas: administrative, educational and juridical. It was a place were I could
              develop with creativity the requirements we got from the clients. The team was
              well integrated and the leadership was stimulating. It were good times. My main
              recollection from this time is the system design made by the main engineer. It was
              an abstract register system composed with client by client derivation, all made on
              Delphi. I could not believe on the time it were possible to express this kind of

              Algebra, Statistics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Formal Languages and
              Machines, Programming Language I (C) and II (Java) and III (Haskell), General
              Systems Theory, Systems Analysis. As for these last two subjects, I need to
              mention professor Claudiomir Selner, who, due to the various references presented
              and by his own, I keep to this day his guidance with esteem and respect. </div>

            <div class="divItemContent">In the Unisul I finished and graduated on. Since the
              course was on-line it was much easier to reconcile with the work I always keep up.
              From the Unisul course I like to remember the administrative lessons on multiple
              technical matters. It was a good starting point with project management,
              entrepreneurship, and professional care of technical organizations. Since I was
              already mostly graduated on the Udesc, and have been working on the fields for
              many years, the technical matters were a breeze. Actually the sensation I recall
              from that times is the good feeling of having your technical skill validate and
              certificate by a valued professional.</div>

            <div class="divItemContent">The Udemy is a amazing platform and I like to keep track
              of what's on. I've made so many courses there that I don't even like to think of
              how much money I've already spent there. Of course, there always a promotion to
              help us addicted to knowledge, but still, it is a lot. Almost every topic I listed
              on the Treating section I have bought a course and spent some hours on it. In the
              future I can clearly seen my self giving some courses there. The best way to more
              profoundly learn is to teach. </div>
